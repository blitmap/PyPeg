**PyPEG**: another *peg parser combinator* library for Python.

This is a (partial) port of Christopher Diggin's [Jigsaw](http:#code.google.com/p/jigsaw-library/) C# 4.0 project.

Christopher used it to build some programming languages like Cat and Heron.

The documentation is still missing, but there's a sample app where you'd see how to parse, then interpret a custom grammar for a sort-of Forth language.
